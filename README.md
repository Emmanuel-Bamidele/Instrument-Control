# Instrument-Control

1) ### FlashControlPy
This repository contains different codes used in controlling instruments for field assisted sintering, and collecting electrical data from such experiments.

The following codes have been added to the repository:

1. Voltage and Temperature Acquisition code for Field Assisted Sintering - especially Flash Sintering. This can find use in cases where the power source is controled by a different code/software or manually and the voltage and temperature retuned need to be recorded. The information containeed in the summary file can be followed to operate the software correctly.
2. Current Control Approach
3. Voltage Control Approach
4. Flash Sintering Control Full Suite
